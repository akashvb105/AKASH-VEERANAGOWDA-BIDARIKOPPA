## Description
This repository contains solutions for a coding test consisting of four problems.
All programs take user input using the `Scanner` class.
The solutions are written using simple logic, basic variables, and a clear program structure,
making them easy to understand for beginners.

## Programs Included

### Program-1.java
- Performs basic arithmetic operations using a class.

### Program-2.java
